WP Latest posts is loading your content from posts, page, tags or custom post type and display it anywhere in your content or as a widget

== Description ==

The main idea of this plugin is to visually take the latest or custom content like WordPress posts, pages, tagged content or custom post type and display it as a slider. Some additional themes are also available. This is definitively the best way to build a news page without coding anything. Build your news layout and letâ€™s take care of your content only.
