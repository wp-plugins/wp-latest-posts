WP Latest post display is taking latest content from posts, page or tags and display it as a slide. News block can be added in editor or as a widget.


== Description == 

The main idea of tis plugin is to visually take the latest post, pages or tagged content and siaply it as a slider.
This is also the best way to do that without doing a page with a custom code inside to get post content from a particular category.
You can create unlimited news block and add them in the editor or as widget.
